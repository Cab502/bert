        "shortmeaning": "A new phase in life and an urge to explore new aspects of yourself. Decisions have to be thought through carefully; don’t lead yourself into unsuitable or difficult situations.",
        "longmeaning": "Something new is starting for the Subject which could be a new relationship, job or home. This is likely to be an exciting time for them with lots of hope and anticipation for the future. The Subject is so caught up in the buzz of it all that they may not be thinking as clearly as they should. The Subject should be receptive to change and doing things they wouldn’t normally. In doing so they will learn about different sides of themself and even discover new things they want out of life. The Subject will be feeling happy, confident and ready to face what is ahead of them.",
        "notesonimage": "The Fool is crossing a bridge to travel to a new kingdom and so this picture illustrates someone embarking on a new journey, a new adventure or start. He carries a small satchel containing his belongings which is representative of the subject being “all in” leaving the past behind and starting completely afresh. He’s not focussed or rushing, in fact he’s playing a flute and wandering along without a care in the world. Almost immediately before him is a hole in the bridge and he is at risk of falling through into the deep, fast moving river below. He’s naively not paying attention to what is ahead of him which could lead him into trouble.",

        "shortmeaning": "A crossroads. An opportunity for constructive change and for you to establish a new, better reality for yourself. You have everything you need to succeed. Capitalise on your skills and creative talents.",
        "longmeaning": "When The Magician appears it is time for the Subject to make a decision about something big which could set them off in a new direction in life. The Subject has the capability to achieve whatever it is they choose and they should be guided by what they feel inside, not necessarily what is expected of them. This card advises they should do whatever their gut is telling them to. This card comes up when it is time for the Subject to take some serious steps forward in life. If the Subject is not where they want or need to be and is doing nothing to resolve it, The Magician will appear. When he does, the Subject is forced to face a situation or a decision between their existing lives and a new direction.",
        "notesonimage": "The Magician stands at a crossroads indicating that we have to decide what route or path to take now. There are no clear directions on the sign post, therefore we are required to make a choice with little information. The Magician encourages us to follow our instinct and to use our innate abilities and to summon up those qualities that lie hidden in our psyche. The Magician is magically manipulating a sword, pentacle, wand and cup between his hands. These objects represent a range of different skills, abilities, tools and resources that we all have – such as intellect, vision, common sense, bravado, and charm – that we can use to maximise our success. The Magician prompts us to think carefully about how we can utilise those skills and resources to achieve the best outcome possible.",

        "shortmeaning": "Growing potential, hidden talents or an unknown destiny gradually coming to the fore. Intuitive skills are heightened; you sense change even though you can’t define the exact nature of it as yet. It can precipitate an interest in mysticism or some form of spiritual awakening.",
        "longmeaning": "The High Priestess represents secrets and things that are yet to come to light. The Subject shouldn’t try to pursue the detail of what is coming but should be prepared for new information to come to the fore. They aren’t aware of everything at play or every influence that will come to bear as yet. This means that now may not the right time to be making important decisions or to make any long term commitments. The playing field is about to change and the Subject won’t know whether it will be a completely different game, a different position in the game or indeed if they’ll be playing with a different team altogether. This card also highlights talents, interest and abilities that are developing in the Subject and they will soon find out something about their overall destiny and direction. They may realise that there is something else they are fated to do. Or that they possess characteristics and abilities they aren’t  aware of yet.",
        "notesonimage": "The High Priestess is portrayed here as a very attractive, mysterious woman attending an altar bearing candles, flowers and a book. It’s as if the person viewing the card has just interrupted her in the midst of some religious/spiritual ceremony or ritual. The High Priestess focuses on a very different side of femininity to The Empress. She is much more ethereal, elusive and alluring, inviting us to use more of our intuition by not giving much away. She is slightly inaccessible standing behind her altar and the viewer is left entranced by her, wanting to know what she knows about them.  But The High Priestess represents that now is not the time to find out.",

        "longmeaning": "The Empress tends to appear where relationships of any kind start to adopt a mother/child dynamic. Even in the midst of a crisis The Empress remains strong and loyal, going to unending lengths for those she loves. When The Empress appears in a spread, the Subject, or someone in their life, may be displaying these qualities which is great. This person’s love and commitment is a great gift because they have much to offer and can be of practical help. However, they are likely to have high expectations in return and when they are not met they become irrational. In these cases good communication is necessary and a compromise between each other’s needs should be reached. The Empress is not happy with changes to relationships that aren’t orchestrated by her. People in relationships portrayed by The Empress may be finding it hard to get support for some sort of change in that relationship.",
        "notesonimage": "The picture shows a beautiful, regal lady admiring a flower and holding her hand to her rounded, pregnant stomach. She is surrounded by nature and the flower has grown to meet her touch which intensifies the portrayal of The Empress’s nurturing side. She wears a crown and has a sceptre which she has chosen to lay to one side whilst she happily enjoys the scene around her. These are signs of her authority and power that remind us that she is a strong and forceful enemy should her rule be challenged or her loved ones put at risk.",

        "shortmeaning": "Can represent a father figure, an older man or a man with authority. Denotes leadership, drive, motivation and success. Make sure you understand the difference between confidence and arrogance, between assertiveness and bullying; don’t get carried away with your successes.",
        "longmeaning": "This card shows the Subject using their skills and resources to improve their situation and, as such, is a very practical card. It is good to have a level of ambition and it is definitely present when The Emperor appears. The journey or task at hand requires self-discipline that could have been missing in the past. When representing the Subject, it shows a determined, powerful person but one that may need to strike a balance between confidence and arrogance. This card shows the Subject has all the traits they need in order to succeed as long as they are used in the right and appropriate way. The Emperor can be an older man in the Subject’s life, possibly a father figure or someone in an authoritative position. It may be that the Subject will receive help from the person represented by The Emperor, but only when they see action and commitment on the part of the Subject, they are only interested in helping people who help themselves. The Subject will need to adopt the right attitude with The Emperor to avoid on-going power struggles.",
        "notesonimage": "The Emperor adopts a slightly confrontational stance between the person looking at the card and his kingdom sitting in the distance behind him. Unlike The Empress, The Emperor holds up his sceptre as a clear sign of his rule and authority. We’re left acutely aware of his ability and readiness to defend his kingdom. He is clever, experienced, strong and protective, and, therefore, can become a very useful ally if brought on side. It’s not easy to gain his trust or respect and he is brash and controlling. The Emperor can be difficult and wily as an enemy so he should always be approached with caution.  Once he is on your side he will be a firm and reliable friend.",

        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "A spiritual mentor or teacher who inspires you and influences your own personal philosophy, belief system or spiritual journey. A desire to learn and gain understanding. Seeking out guidance and a spiritual code of conduct to live by; striving to be the best you can be.",
        "longmeaning": " The Subject is thinking about their beliefs and how this affects their lives. In more conventional religions, the requirements and expectations in terms of behaviour are clear, and each has its own set of rules. If the Subject and their beliefs aren’t conventional, or part of an organised religion, they may be wondering what their spiritual “code of conduct” is. There could be a counsellor, priest or just a valued friend in the Subject’s life who they go to for advice and guidance. They could be encouraging the Subject to make positive and constructive change in their life or to seek out something more meaningful than they have at present. Always process the thoughts and opinions of others against personal experiences and beliefs, religious or otherwise. The message here is that whilst remaining open to other perspectives and attitudes, avoid blindly following just for the sake of having something to follow.",
        "notesonimage": "The Hierophant is a studious man sitting calmly, reading a book, with more books piled up to his side revealing him as a knowledgeable person. This person could be a priest, adviser or mentor of some description, or even a respected friend or colleague to whom one might turn to for advice.  Although he is engrossed and not looking at us the image depicts The Hierophant as seated with refreshment at his side, indicating this is someone who is willing to spend time considering information or discussing issues.  There is a rich warm carpet for those who wish to sit at his feet and learn. The Hierophant is an authoritative figure but unlike the Emperor, The Hierophant’s power and leadership comes from his developed spiritual wisdom and experience. He has an innate understanding of the way things work and he knows the attitudes and behaviours that will be of most benefit to the subject now.",

        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "Represents choices to be made usually within romantic relationships or else partnerships where feelings are particularly strong. You need to act with honesty and from a point of love for everyone involved. Think carefully about the implications of your decisions.",
        "longmeaning": "The Lovers can commonly indicate temptation away from a relationship because feelings have developed elsewhere. As well as indicating romantic relationships the Subject could find themselves caught between the needs and demands of different types of relationships and feel they face an impossible choice between people they love. The situation depicted by this card is always going to be a difficult one because emotions are running high. Without true consideration for all the people involved there stands to be a lot of hurt and upset. The best advice would be to think through the consequences of any decisions carefully. The Subject should be aware of what they truly need and where they are prepared to compromise. The needs and wishes of others should also be considered, to strike a fair balance for all concerned. At the end of the day they will only be able to be at peace knowing they did their very best, acting from a point of love and consideration for everyone involved.",
        "notesonimage": "A woman is walking away from a man towards an extended hand from outside of the picture, which represents temptation of any kind such as a desire for a different lifestyle, not just physical love affairs.  She has turned her back entirely on the main figure although her left arm is stretched back towards him, which indicates that she’s unsure about the decision she has made or that she really does still care for him. The man is looking down and holding his hand to his chest clearly displaying his hurt. Like the woman, his other arm still reaches backward to her almost as if he’s hoping she’ll come back.  In some ways this image can represent a stalemate in a situation which may be reparable given the right treatment.  It is an uncomfortable but emotional scene that should nudge the subject to think carefully about the choices they are making and the affect they’re having on people around them.",

        "arcana": "Major Arcana",
        "suit": null,
        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "A difficult situation pulls you in different directions; your morality could even be in question. Make your decision and mean it. Take control of your emotions and channel them constructively. Commit to your decision fully and find the strength to deal with all the consequences of your choice, good or bad.",
        "longmeaning": "The Subject is being pulled in different directions and they are struggling to know what action to take. Things are happening quickly and it feels as if there really isn’t much time for the Subject to get a grip on what’s happening. Rather than desperately trying to play catch up with events, the Subject needs to take control, grab the reins and direct events firmly. If the Charioteer does not take action now, he’ll almost certainly end up in a collision! The Subject needs to decide what action to take and channel their energies in to making things right again. The Subject is ill advised to act in an underhand or deceitful manner – no matter how complicated and confused boundaries have become. As always, they should act from a point of love and respect for everyone concerned to be sure that they did the right thing and made the right choice.",
        "notesonimage": "The Charioteer is steering the chariot down a narrow tree bordered lane and he is focusing to keep control of it. The horses are the opposite colours and pulling off in different directions to symbolise conflicting forces, and there is imminent danger of collision should one of the horses succeed in gaining control. The Charioteer is using all his talent, strength and ability to keep the vehicle on track despite being pulled this way and that by the horses.  In a reading, this card would represent the need to adopt a similar stance to drive something forward, to keep steady hands on the reins and manage opposition and potential problems, no matter what the difficulties.",

        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "You won’t change a situation by being pushy or demanding and avoid being arrogant or proud. Harness feelings of anger or resentment and channel them into something more constructive that can better your situation. There is a difference between assertion and aggression.",
        "longmeaning": "Strength is very much related to the Subject’s ego and, when this card appears, it is likely they have an internal struggle on their hands. They may feel that they have been badly treated, or misunderstood, but the situation needs careful examination to see whether any of the Subject’s behaviours are contributing to the issue. For now, they should work to contain their extreme emotions and act appropriately to achieve what they really want. It is likely the Subject has an over-inflated opinion of them self, or even misplaced pride. They may feel that they are the centre of a situation which is not actually about them, or they feel they have greater influence than they actually do, so the resultant realisation that they are not, and they don’t, may have a negative impact on their self esteem and confidence. It is those battles with ourselves, our own faults, weaknesses and mistakes that are most difficult for us to recognise and face. The Subject should master negative emotions of anger and resentment. Even when we think we are right, we should have the strength of character to control ourselves, and the way we behave.",
        "notesonimage": "This picture shows a man in a bare-hand battle with a lion. He has driven his sword into the ground beside him. This man is clearly courageous and confident in his abilities, and he seems to have chosen to battle with the lion, in this particularly dangerous way, instead of cutting away with his sword. Courage, strength and fortitude are admirable traits that should be encouraged. However, situations can be misread, or underestimated, and such an aggressive and over-confident reaction can be entirely inappropriate and damaging. The man is not winning or losing the battle, at this point, and his over confidence may have led him into unnecessary difficulty.",

        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "Advises or represents a period of introspection, possibly withdrawal, and reflective thinking. Usually at the point of facing some external limitation. There is something that you cannot change or have. It is important to know that some things will only heal, become clear or resolve with the passing of time.",
        "longmeaning": "The Subject feels they have little control over a situation and may have chosen to withdraw from it and people around them. As this is a Major Arcana card, this card indicates the situation is of particular significance or importance to the Subject and they may feel lonely or disconnected. Perhaps they are facing a situation alone because it is very personal to them (such as illness) or it could be something they are not willing to share with others. The Subject is probably anxious to know when this situation will change or move forward, but only time will tell in this case, The Subject should wait and see how things develop, as impatience is likely to make things worse. If the Subject pushes too hard for what they want they are likely to lose out altogether, or at least create additional setbacks.  Reflective thinking, and allowing this situation to unfold, will bring enlightenment, and sometimes we have to accept that things will not happen until the time is right.  Nor should we totally isolate ourselves from those that care about us.",
        "notesonimage": "The Hermit is dressed in a heavy gown and cloak for warmth, and sits at the entrance to the cave.  The long beard indicates he has little or no luxuries for his personal needs and has chosen to be there in isolation to focus his time on thinking and reflecting. The image reminds us of the advantages of taking time out for introspection, to process what has happened in life and understand lessons learned or to concentrate on particular problems that are giving us trouble. The Hermit holds a staff and lantern which he uses to help guide travellers who shouldn’t venture into the dark cave unguided, a reminder that no one should withdraw from society completely. The subject should take time to look into, and after, their own needs but they need to remember that, at other times, they’ll need help and support from others.",

        "description": "TO-DO",
        "shortmeaning": "Points to the ups and downs and successes and failures we experience in life. Whatever your particular circumstance, be reminded that nothing is permanent and the wheel will turn again. Recognising the cyclical nature of life means you can seize opportunities when the wheel turns in your favour and wait patiently, with hope, when it does not.",
        "longmeaning": "Whenever we begin something we know it will eventually end. When life isn’t going so well, we have faith that things will get better. When life is good we try desperately to appreciate those moments because we all know that there will undoubtedly be some difficult times ahead. This is the cyclical nature of life and we all have to come to accept it. Whilst endings are often sad and feared, they also allow space and freedom for the Subject to embark on something new that may bring them even greater joy if they can just see through the transition. If things are currently going well for the Subject, The Wheel of Fortune serves as a reminder to enjoy what they have right now as things may not remain rosy for any length of time. The Wheel of Fortune can brighten the Subject’s reading, and show them the light at the end of the tunnel, if they have been having a bad time. The Subject should remember that opportunity lies in the darkest of places  and these are the times we become enlightened and strong.",
        "notesonimage": "In the picture the cloaked figure spins The Wheel of Fortune to decide the man’s fate. The man’s hand is raised as if to ask ‘Can I stop it where I want to?’ but there is no response and the wheel continues to turn regardless showing that, at times, we have no control over some of the things that happen to us. If we chose all our own battles and challenges we’d rarely stretch ourselves in the way that we do through the problems we are faced with, and we’d never learn to become more than we currently are. The wheel will stop wherever, and whenever, it does and we must just accept the consequences and face what is before us so that we can learn to make the most of the good times and learn from the bad.",

        "shortmeaning": "You seek acknowledgment for something you have achieved or have recently come through. You want to be recognised and treated fairly and with honesty. You need time to think reflectively, and rationally, to make the right decision and take the right action. If you can, justice will prevail.",
        "longmeaning": "The Subject may be dealing with the legal aspects of a situation, possibly looking at contracts or progressing through a system/process to achieve something. The Subject will be hoping for a fair conclusion. Whilst this situation continues, they need to keep their emotions in check. The Subject has strong opinions about what is happening and the way they have been treated. The only way to resolve this situation is by remaining as objective and impartial as they possibly can. No matter how unjust they think things are and no matter how overwhelming the Subject’s emotional reaction is, only reflective thinking will yield the right result. In a similar way to the Suit of Swords, Justice refers to the mental ability of the Subject, and the extent to which they can control their feelings through the power of rational thought. They need to refrain from reacting emotionally long enough to make the right and appropriate set of decisions.",
        "notesonimage": "A large but simple golden throne blocks the road and a lady sits calmly. She’s been waiting for the subject to arrive and the subject cannot progress any further down the line until their experience with Justice is done. Whilst she’s not an intimidating figure, the throne signifies her authority, here and now. The sword held in her right hand is a gesture to the suit dedicated to mental aptitude, attitude and conduct which she has conquered. In her left hand she holds the scales that represent balance, so the outcome should be fair, whatever it is, providing her guidance is taken.",

        "longmeaning": "The Hanged Man appears in a reading when the Subject needs to accept something difficult. They need to look at the situation and be completely honest about what they want in their life in comparison to what they actually have. They should attempt to truly assess the impact of existing situations or relationships and evaluate what needs to be done. Do they have healthy relationships? Are they involved in situations that are holding them back? Maybe what they want just isn’t right or available to them at the moment and the Subject is unhappy to let it go. This is an upsetting and painful process for them to go through. They need to stop struggling against it so much. The Subject has to relinquish control of the outcome and they fear that, in losing that control, they will lose something they love or hold dear. There is no choice for the Subject though, they cannot change the outcome or make any difference now. If they can truly accept this they will be able to focus their energy elsewhere and the transition will be easier.",
        "notesonimage": "This poor man hangs suspended, upside down, from a beam perched between two trees. Only one of his legs are tied to indicate that this is not a punishment enforced on him by someone else – but more that he has been forced to relinquish control of his destiny for a period of time. There is little he can do to change his circumstances, and to struggle will only cause him more pain and suffering. He is not happy at all, but he is calm and does not waste his time and energy, or cause himself pain, by protesting or fighting against this imposition. Whether an enforced change or a voluntary self-sacrifice, the message of the image is to accept the circumstance and stop fighting or struggling against what is happening. This is a good time to learn patience and to keep calm under pressure.",

        "shortmeaning": "Something is coming to an end or has run its course. Letting go can be painful and the saying “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is apt. This change is necessary and your capacity to accept it will make it easier to endure. Turn to face a new future, a new reality knowing new opportunities are available to you.",
        "longmeaning": "Death is probably the most famous and feared Tarot card of all. Rather than foretelling the death of the Subject, or someone they know, this card relates to a process of change. Death indicates the physical and emotional challenges that must take place for the Subject to move on….the final recognition that something has ended and they must start again.  This can be extremely upsetting for the Subject; having to let go of a way of life, a relationship or anything that has been loved is clearly distressing. One of Death’s messages is that acceptance and understanding can ease the Subject’s pain and suffering. When they are ready they will direct their attention and energy into something new. They will turn to face the future and be ready for a new reality. When Death appears in a spread it is time for the Subject to accept that what is gone is gone. By looking forward to a new beginning they can start the process of healing that will ease the pain of letting go. The Subject is encouraged to redirect the energy they spend in lamenting over the past, to working towards a new future.",
        "notesonimage": "Here, Death is portrayed as the traditional Grim Reaper scything away all before him. Everything he touches dies and he leaves a wake of destruction behind him but ahead of him there is sunshine, life and promise. The imagery here is intense and can often be rather daunting, but the picture is merely symbolic of the past, which is being left behind and is of no use to us now, and we must face the future. Each brand new day brings bright promises and the sustenance we need to grow.  The sun always rises and it seems Death can never keep up with the sun – it continues to rise daily, come what may.",

        "shortmeaning": "You need to give and invest more of yourself, your feelings and emotions into the situation at hand. To improve circumstances, be ready and willing to affirm your commitment and love. Move on from the past where necessary and avoid actions that could be perceived as cold or manipulative.",
        "longmeaning": "In Justice the message is about retaining enough intellectual clarity to make clear and fair decisions. In contrast, Temperance focuses on the emotions and working hard to maintain balance in relationships. It is very easy to get out of touch with our own feelings, let alone staying in tune with the people around us. The Subject is likely to be struggling with an important partnership. Relationships of any kind are difficult and it is not possible to be head over heels in love, to remain completely enthralled, with another person over long periods of time.  However, withdrawing a loving attitude from a relationship will undoubtedly create more issues. Dealing with this situation on an intellectual level is not what will help at this time.  Subject should not be allowing the head to rule the heart.  Sentiment, affection and kindness will count for a lot more and can manifest as reassurance for the other party, easing the problem at hand.",
        "notesonimage": "Temperance is a winged, angel like, figure hovering over running water.  She is pouring a rainbow-like liquid, back and forth between two chalices very carefully so as not to spill any. These are all symbols self-discipline, care and balance designed to illustrate the virtue of temperance. The image, with the rainbow and the river, depicts the element of Water and draws us into the emotional world of the ‘Cups’ suit.  This card should prompt the subject that they may need to check how they are balancing their logical and emotional input into any current issues.",

You can control these tendencies, avoid unnecessary temptations and make change for the better. If you do, you will be freed from the negative emotions you feel.",
        "longmeaning": "The Devil is an inward looking card. It points to those things the Subject might be ashamed of and would be reluctant to share with, or exhibit, to the outside world. The Devil can represent many different internal facets of behaviour, and they range widely with the hold they can have over the Subject. The most recognisable might be certain sexual fantasies and desires, different kinds of addictions and, of course, abuse. The Devil can also represent restrictive lifestyles, relationships, and issues with boundaries. Whatever it is, it brings about feelings of shame, fear and anxiety within the Subject. It is time to deal with the situation rather than continue be controlled by it. If it is self-destructive or addictive behaviour, it is time to open up and be honest – seek support and guidance where appropriate. Likewise, if the Subject feels bound by a long held secret, maybe it is time to bring it into the open, so they can be free of the burden. The message in this card is to admit to these binds, and make effort to overcome them, in order to be able to move on to a lighter way of life.",
        "notesonimage": "In the picture, the Devil appears to have some control over the woman who is kneeling on the ground with her face in her hands, and she is clearly distressed. She is surrounded by hell fire and appears to be trapped and doomed. However, she is not chained or bound, in any way, and could make a bid for freedom if she chose to. Here The Devil represents situations, addictions, behaviours, or relationships, that have become overwhelming and constricting. The subject is encouraged to find out where they can regain control of their life by facing their demons rather than succumbing to them, so they can create a better reality.",

        "shortmeaning": "Significant change and disruption to some key aspect of your life such as your home or a relationship. This is, undoubtedly, an upsetting experience but know that there is opportunity to build a new, improved reality. With time you are likely to see this as a blessing in disguise.",
        "longmeaning": "There are a number of cards in Tarot that depict change, because change is one of the most fundamental and consistent parts of life. It is something that everyone will face and cannot be avoided. It could be the exposure of a situation where the Subject isn’t being true to them self, or others, and they will be seen as they truly are rather than the persona they adopt for the outside world. The Subject might want to think about telling the truth themselves, rather than being exposed by circumstances out of their control. The Tower will inevitably crumble and only the Subject can limit the resultant damage. However, it is often a blessing in disguise, because what emerges from the wreck is better for them. They can finally be as they really are and there is nothing better than getting validation and acceptance for who and what you truly are, rather than trying to be something that other people want.",
        "notesonimage": "The Tower is falling apart having been struck by lightning, and flames can be seen coming from inside the structure. The element of fire refers to total and utter transformation because almost nothing looks or feels the same once it has been through fire; this image is all about significant, irreversible change. The devastation of Tower by some external force is representative of something that has come crashing down for the subject and it has had a major impact.  The likelihood is that they have little control over the outcome of the situation.",

        "longmeaning": "The Star tarot card brings us a message of hope – a bright light which shines in dark times.  When things are tough, a person’s attitude to a situation will determine how easy or difficult it is for them to get through, as well as what they are, or are not, happy to endure in the pursuit of what they want.  Those that keep hope in their heart will be motivated to keep going but those without hope may feel they have nothing to fight for, or indeed live for, and are more likely to give up. Hope for the future can be our driver, our motivation. It is important that the Subject should continue on day to day, despite it being a dark and rather miserable time. The Star reminds us that there will be a better, brighter time in the future; that the Subject will be able to enjoy life once again; that things will move on.  Although it seems like nothing is changing for the Subject and they are struggling with their day to day existence, each little task is important, to just keep going is important.  In a reading, the Reader should look at surrounding cards, however, to ascertain if the Subject has false hope, or misplaced belief, in a situation or person, that might actually be causing the stagnation.",
        "notesonimage": "A young woman sits on dark, rugged rocks collecting and pouring water from a flask into the fast flowing river, and this is all she is doing.  It may seem like a pointless and useless task, just as the Subject may feel their efforts are having no real impact on their life at the moment. Whilst the image shows a relatively calm scene, the woman has no clear path back or ahead which can show that the subject is lacking in direction and may be stuck in a rut. The Star is a beacon of hope and shines brightly, reflected in the river, representing that which seems pointless today will yield something better in the future, that we must continue with our daily mundane tasks and seemingly trivial existence until the time when direction and clarity find us once again.",

This is a time for cleansing, a time to heal and to leave the past behind. Things will become clearer and a brighter future is available when you are ready for it.",
        "longmeaning": "The Moon appears when the Subject doesn’t know the full story. The Subject may be waiting for something to happen or for someone to be more open and honest with them but they should also be guided by their intuition. They will know what is right and wrong, what is worth waiting for and pursuing; and those things that are not what they seem and which need to be left well alone. They should be careful not to fill gaps in their knowledge by dreaming about what may, or may not, be. They need to wait for more information before trying to determine the outcome. The Moon can often represent a secret love affair.  In this kind of relationship, the development of this liaison could be out of the Subject’s hands and, so, if the Subject wants to pursue the affair they’ll remain in the uncertainty of The Moon, with little control over the outcome. If the Subject chooses not to pursue it they can take control of their own destiny and move on. Of course, some things are worth waiting for and this is what the Subject and Reader will have to decipher together.",

Cards such as The Sun and The World are the points in life we all strive and aspire to, they’re the positive outcome cards we all want to see. They depict the times when we can enjoy the fruits of our labours and feel proud of ourselves for what we have done and achieved. It is really important to take some time to stop and appreciate the moment, the place, the people, the love. Likewise, the Subject should take note of the lessons learned in Strength which is to not let ambition and success go to their head or dictate who they are or how they behave. They should remember to strike a balance between enjoying the moment, understanding their own value, and not getting carried away with the hype around them right now.",

The Sun gives life; we simply cannot survive without it. The couple and the baby in this picture have a lot to be thankful for and they are acknowledging The Sun for the bounty it gives them. A time for the Subject to feel happy and grateful for what they have, recognising all the wonderful things in their lives. A time when they can be happy with their lot.

This card can relate to outcomes of all kinds in relationships, work life or material or creative pursuits. People are generally enthused and want to highlight and celebrate their success, and rightly so. People who have worked long and hard, and who have not waivered from their ethical principles in order to achieve their goal, will receive their longed-for recognition. If, however, Judgement means the Subject is to face up to some negative consequence of their actions, the lesson is to learn something about how they go about achieving their goals in life. When the Subject looks back over events they’ll remember what they had to do to get there and the extent to which it was right and moral. The Subject is asked to consider if they are happy with all of their actions, input and work to get to this point or, with hindsight, would they choose to do anything differently? These lessons need to be held on to and used for future reference.",

Is she exalted that she has done things in the best possible way?  Or is she pleading for another go because she got it wrong?  It doesn’t really matter – this image is to depict external and internal judgement – something we all have to face at some point.",
